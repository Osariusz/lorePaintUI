# **LorePaint - Collaborative Mapping Made Simple (React Frontend)**  

LorePaint’s React frontend. Designed for seamless teamwork, it supports real-time updates and smooth user interactions with WebSockets.

### Core Features  
- **Real-Time Collaboration with WebSockets:** Provides live updates and cursor tracking with React hooks, ensuring users are always in sync when making changes to the map.
- **Responsive Design:** A mobile-friendly interface that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring smooth navigation and interaction on all devices.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The frontend is built using React’s modular component system, ensuring flexibility, maintainability, and scalability.

### Why It Stands Out  
- 🌍 **Real-Time Collaboration:** Live collaboration tools like cursor tracking and role-based editing, providing an engaging and interactive user experience.  
- 🚀 **Scalable and Modular:** A robust frontend built with React’s component-driven approach, perfect for expanding and scaling as new features are added.
